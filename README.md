# Young Athlete Injury Prevention Guide

## Project Goal

This repository aims to compile a comprehensive, evidence-based "Best Practices Guide" for preventing overuse injuries in young athletes, particularly those who specialize in a single sport. Overuse injuries such as stress fractures, tendonitis, and growth plate injuries are common in youth sports and can have long-term consequences if not properly managed.

## Scope

The guide will cover:
- Nutritional factors for bone health in adolescents
- Principles for safe weekly training load progression
- Effective recovery and sleep hygiene strategies
- Additional topics as identified by the community

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from sports scientists, health advocates, coaches, and parents. Please see our [Issues](https://github.com/manuelczenny/young-athlete-injury-prevention/issues) section for current tasks and discussions.
